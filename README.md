# brain-tumor-classification
This project applies state-of-the-art deep learning models (VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionResNet) to classify MRI-based brain tumors with high accuracy. Using transfer learning, fine-tuning, and Grad-CAM visualizations, it enhances medical diagnosis by identifying tumor regions.
